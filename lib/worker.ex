defmodule Skitter.Worker do
  @moduledoc """
  Worker which manages state and performs computations for a component.

  Workers are spawned by strategies to manage state and perform computations for a given
  component. Any component or strategy state not stored in the deployment lives in a worker.

  Skitter workers are created by strategies with an initial state. Any messages received by the
  worker are handled by the `c:Skitter.Strategy.Component.receive/4` hook of its strategy. This
  callback receives the current worker state and may return a new, udpated state to be stored by
  the worker.

  Since strategies can create many separate workers, each worker is created with a _tag_ which can
  be used by the strategy to provide different implementations of
  `c:Skitter.Strategy.Component.receive/4` based on the worker that received the message.

  This module defines the worker types and various functions to deal with workers.

  Placement constraints.

  When spawning a worker, it is often desirable to tweak on which node the worker will be placed.
  This type defines a set of placement constraints which can be passed as an argument to
  `create/4`.

  The following constraints are defined:

  - `nil`: No constraints.
  - `local`: Try to spawn the worker on the local node. Note that this constraints will be ignored
  when executed on a master node.
  - `on: node`: Spawn the worker at the specified node.
  - `with: ref`: Spawn the worker on the same node as the worker identified by `ref`.
  - `avoid: ref`: Try to place the worker on a different node than the worker identified by `ref`.
  - `tagged: tag`: Try to place the worker on a node with a specific `t:Skitter.Nodes.tag/0`.

  Note that it is not always possible to match the desired constraints. When this is the case, a
  warning will be logged.
